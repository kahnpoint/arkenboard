# Arkenboard
Arkenboard is my LOTR-inspired keyboard build.

It uses a qwerty layout on the actual hardware, but uses AutoHotkey to remap the keys to a custom layout (quoi) and add function layers.
This way, the hotkey layer can be disabled to use it for qwerty-based applications, like gaming.

It treats the two halves as seperate keyboards to support using the roller balls as 2 mice (and scroll wheels). Why 2 mice? Simple: 2 hands.

TODO
- Keymap Graphic
- Toggle AHK with keypress
- Chording?
- Look into horizontal scroll lag
